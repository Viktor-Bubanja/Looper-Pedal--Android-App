# Looper-Pedal--Android-App
Looper is an Android app that simulates a looper pedal by allowing users to record and loop audio. Users can interact with the app hands-free using Looperâ€™s motion detection, allowing them to keep playing their instruments without interuption. For example, users can place their device on their leg as they record then move their leg to start/stop recording.
